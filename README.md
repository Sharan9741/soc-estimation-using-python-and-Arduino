# üîã Estimating Battery SoC with an Extended Kalman Filter (python)  and an Arduino

## Project Overview
This project implements an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the State of Charge (SoC) of a battery  using python  . Accurate SoC estimation helps prevent battery degradation and extends battery life. The implementation is based on an Arduino for basic hardware processing and real-time estimation. 

## What is an Extended Kalman Filter?
An EKF is a powerful algorithm that combines a physics-based model with a machine learning approach to estimate battery SoC accurately. It is the same principle used in smartphones to determine battery percentage. The algorithm continuously updates its predictions based on past errors, improving accuracy over time.

## Creating the Physics-Based Model
To build the EKF, we first needed to derive equations representing the battery‚Äôs physical behavior. This involved:

1. **OCV-SOC Curve Generation**: The first thing I did was discharge the battery from 100% to 0% SOC at constant, low, current. This allowed me to create an OCV-SOC curve, which relates open circuit voltage (voltage across battery terminals when it's not connected to a load) to state of charge .
OCV is different than terminal voltage, and terminal voltage is what you can actually measure. So I needed to relate OCV to terminal voltage. And to do that, I used a Thevenin equivalent circuit model (ECM). This is a simplified representation of a battery. To determine the values for R1, R2, and C1, I needed to do a pulse discharge test on the battery
   
2. **Thevenin Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM)**: Since terminal voltage (measurable) differs from OCV, we used an ECM to relate them. The ECM consists of resistors and a capacitor that model the battery‚Äôs internal characteristics. To determine the values of R1, R2, and C1, we conducted a pulse discharge test.

### Hardware Setup

## The EKF Algorithm
The EKF works by predicting SoC using:
1. **State Transition Model (f function)**: Uses discharge current, battery efficiency, and other parameters to estimate SoC.
2. **Measurement Model**: Compares the predicted SoC value with the ‚Äúmeasured‚Äù value derived from voltage readings and the physics-based model.
3. **Kalman Gain Computation**: The algorithm assigns weightings to predictions based on past errors, refining the final SoC estimate.

## Implementation
### Arduino Integration
- The Arduino reads real-time voltage and current sensor data.
- The EKF algorithm runs on the Arduino to update SoC estimates dynamically.

### Software & Tools
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino
- **Languages**: C++ (Arduino IDE)
- **Modeling**: python for parameter estimation

## How to Use
